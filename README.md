Count the randomly generated quads.
Î‘ code in Python that takes the dimension of a square and will make the corresponding table from lists. 
It will then find the number of positions and randomly fill half of them with units (rounding up). 
The goal is to count how many quads of units there are horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. 
The program is repeated 100 times (for the same dimension) and returns the average of the quadrats.
